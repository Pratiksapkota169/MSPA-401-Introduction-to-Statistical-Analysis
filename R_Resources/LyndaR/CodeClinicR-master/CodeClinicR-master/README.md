# CodeClinicR
===========
A version of lynda.com code clinic for the R programming language.

Successful programmers know more than just a computer languageâ€“they also know how to think about solving problems by breaking a problem down into segments that lend themselves to technical solutions. Code Clinic is a series of courses where lynda.com authors solve the same problems, using different programming languages.

As the content Manager for the Developer Segment at lynda.com, I curated the series. As a project, I taught myself R and completed the Code Clinic: R course.

## All Code Clinic Courses solve the following problems:
*  Data Science / Big Data - Exploring Lake Pend Oreille
*  Image Analysis
*  Eight Queens
*  Accessing Peripherals - Build a Theremin
*  Recursion and Directories
*  Building Dynamic Web Pages

## Code Clinic sessions are available for:
*    C++
*    C#
*    Java
*    PHP
*    Python
*    Ruby
*    and now - R
